            That there, that's not me
            I go where I please
            I walk through walls
            I float down the Liffey

            I'm not here
            This isn't happening
            I'm not here, I'm not here

            In a little while
            I'll be gone
            The moment's already passed
            Yeah, it's gone

            I'm not here
            This isn't happening
            I'm not here, I'm not here

            Strobe lights and blown speakers
            Fireworks and hurricanes

            I'm not here
            This isn't happening
            I'm not here, I'm not here....

        <h1 id='song2'>Massive Attack - Teardrop</h1>
        <p><pre>
            Love, love is a verb
            Love is a doing word
            Fearless on my breath
            Gentle impulsion
            Shakes me, makes me lighter
            Fearless on my breath
            Teardrop on the fire
            Fearless on my breath
            Night, night of matter
            Black flowers blossom
            Fearless on my breath
            Black flowers blossom
            Fearless on my breath
            Teardrop on the fire
            Fearless on my
            Water is my eye
            Most faithful mirror
            Fearless on my breath
            Teardrop on the fire
            Of a confession
            Fearless on my breath
            Most faithful mirror
            Fearless on my breath
            Teardrop on the fire
            Fearless on my breath
            It's tumbling down (as in love falling apart)
            It's tumbling down (as in love falling apart)

        <p><pre>
            Someone said they left together
            I ran out the door to get her
            She was holding hands with Trevor
            Not the greatest feeling ever
            Said, "Pull yourself together
            You should try your luck with Heather"
            Then I heard they slept together
            Oh, the less I know the better
            The less I know the better
            Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side
            No surprise when you're on his shoulder like every night
            Oh my love, can't you see that you're on my mind
            Don't suppose we could convince your lover to change his mind
            So goodbye
            She said, "It's not now or never
            Wait ten years, we'll be together"
            I said, "Better late than never
            Just don't make me wait forever"
            Don't make me wait forever
            Don't make me wait forever
            Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
            I don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind
            I was doing fine without you
            'Til I saw your face, now I can't erase
            Giving in to all his bullshit
            Is this what you want, is this who you are?
            I was doing fine without you
            'Til I saw your eyes turn away from mine
            Oh, sweet darling, where he wants you
            Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"
            Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"
            Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"

            Immunity
            Long overdue
            Contagion
            I exhale you
            Naive
            I opened up to you
            Venom in mania
            Now, contagion
            I exhale you
            The deceiver says, he says
            You belong to me
            You don't wanna breathe the light of the others
            Fear the light
            Fear the breath
            Fear the others for eternity
            But I hear them now inhale the clarity
            Hear the venom, the venom in
            What you say inoculated
            Bless this immunity
            Bless this immunity
            Bless this immunity
            Exhale, expel
            Recast my tale
            Read my allegorical elegy
            Enumerate
            All that I'm to do
            Calculating steps away from you
            My own
            Mitosis
            Growing through
            Delusion from mania
            Exhale, expel
            Recast my tale
            Weave my allegorical elegy
            Forfeit
            All control
            You poison
            You spectacle
            Exorcise the spectacle
            Exorcise the malady
            Exorcise the disparate
            Poison for eternity
            Purge me and evacuate
            The venom and the fear that binds me
            Unveil now
            Lift away
            I see you
            Running
            Deceiver
            Chased away
            A long time
            Coming
        </pre></p>

            Rage is a quiet thing
            You think that you've tamed it
            But it's just lying in wait
            Oh
            Rage
            Is it in our veins?
            Feel it in my face when I least expect it
            Give in
            Control
            There's so many ways to give in
            Eyes close
            Another way to make it to ten
            Oh how to draw the line between wrath and mercy?
            Gotta simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer down
            Control
            There's so many ways to give in
            Eyes close
            Another way to make it to ten
            Oh how to draw the line between wrath and mercy?
            Gotta simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer down
            If I had seen my reflection
            As something more precious
            He would've never
            Mmm and if my child needed protection
            From a fucker like that man
            I'd sooner gut him
            'Cause nothing cuts like a mother
            Give in
            Control
            There's so many ways to give in
            Eyes close
            Another way to make it to ten
            Oh how to draw the line between wrath and mercy?
            Simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer down
            Control
            There's so many ways to give in
            Eyes close
            Another way to make it to ten
            Oh, how to draw the line between wrath and mercy?
            Simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer down
            Wrap yourself in petals
            Wrap yourself in petals
            Wrap yourself in petals for armor
            Petals for armor
            Give In
            Control
            There's so many ways to give in
            Eyes close
            Another way to make it to ten
            Oh how to draw the line between wrath and mercy?
            Gotta simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer down
            Control
            There's so many ways to give in
            Eyes close
            Another way to make it to ten
            Oh how to draw the line between wrath and mercy?
            Gotta simmer, simmer, simmer
